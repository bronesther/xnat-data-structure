# XNAT Data Structure specification

This repository contains the specifications and work for the XNAT Data Structure definition. The goal of this definition is to give insight in how non-raw DICOM data in an XNAT project is structured, what the files contain and allow users to expose this structure through the API to be used in conjunction with tools like [xnatpy](https://xnat.readthedocs.io/).
